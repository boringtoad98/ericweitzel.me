              Using <code>sysupgrade</code> will cause your system to fetch all file sets. If you would rather choose your own, use <code><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/signify">signify(1)</a></code> instead.

        <p>Now that OpenBSD 7.1 has been released, it's time to start the incredibly easy task of performing a system upgrade.</p>
        <p>For a typical unattended upgrade, all we have to do is run <code><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a></code> and let OpenBSD upgrade itself:</p>
          <pre><div># sysupgrade</div></pre>
          <p>That's it. Seriously. Under certain circumstances, <code><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge">sysmerge(8)</a></code> fails to automatically update the required configuration files. In that case, we can just run it manually:</p>
          <pre><div># sysmerge</div></pre>
        <p>If you want to upgrade another way, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade71.html">the official FAQ has an excellent upgrade guide</a>.</p>
