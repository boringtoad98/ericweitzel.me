        Generating audio with pure C
      </title>
      <description>
        I've been working on a project that requires the ability to generate uncompressed PCM audio. Luckily, C lets us do this very easily just using structs and fwrite.

        Persistent display brightness on OpenBSD with rc and wsconsctl
      </title>
      <description>
        Laptop users of OpenBSD know that there's no built-in functionality for keeping the display's brightness persistent across reboots. It's possible to use rc(8) and wsconsctl(8) to write the display's brightness setting to a file on shutdown and read it during startup.
